            <h1>The Dog</h1>
            <small>Wikipedia</small>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
              it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first 
              species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. Due to their long 
              association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a 
              starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>

            <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15–24 lb).
                All puppies display primary altriciality and healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows
                older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers 
                specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks</p>
